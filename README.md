SPI Interface with RAM
Overview
This project implements a Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) to communicate with a RAM module using Verilog. The design allows efficient read/write operations to RAM via SPI, making it ideal for embedded systems and other applications requiring low-pin count memory interfacing and i use questa sim 2021 and vivado 2018 .

Features
Efficient Data Transfer: Fast and reliable communication between SPI and RAM.
Full-Duplex Communication: Simultaneous read and write operations.
Configurable Data Width: Supports various data widths, enhancing flexibility.
Low Latency: Optimized for minimal delay between SPI transactions and RAM access.
Modular Design: Easy to integrate into larger systems or customize for specific needs.
Getting Started:

Signal Descriptions
MISO (Master In Slave Out): This signal carries data from the RAM to the SPI master during read operations. It is an output from the RAM and input to the master.
MOSI (Master Out Slave In): This signal carries data from the SPI master to the RAM during write operations. It is an output from the master and input to the RAM.
SS_N (Slave Select, Active Low): This active-low signal is used to select the RAM as the active slave device. When SS_N is low, the RAM is enabled for communication; when high, the RAM is inactive.
RST_N (Reset, Active Low): This active-low signal resets the SPI interface and RAM module. When asserted (low), it initializes the system, ensuring it starts from a known state.
CLK (Clock): The clock signal drives the SPI interface, synchronizing data transmission between the master and the RAM. Each bit of data is sampled on the rising or falling edge of the clock, depending on the SPI mode.

Prerequisites

Before using this project, ensure you have the following:

Verilog Compiler: To simulate and synthesize the design.
FPGA Toolchain: If you plan to deploy this on an FPGA.
Testbench: Included in the repository to validate functionality.
